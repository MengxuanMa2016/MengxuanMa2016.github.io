      <blockquote cite="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/worlds-older-population-grows-dramatically">
        The world’s older population continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Today, 8.5 percent of people worldwide
        (617 million) are aged 65 and over. According to a new report, “An Aging World: 2015,” this percentage is
        projected to jump to nearly 17 percent of the world’s population by 2050 (1.6 billion).

      <p>Traditional ways to take care of elder people involve family members or a paid daycare. It is not only
        difficult logistically, but also emotionally and financially. Developing new healthcare technologies can reduce
        the burden of the caregiver and allow seniors to live their most fulfilled and independent lives possible. As a
        graduate student majoring in electrical and computer engineering, I’m encouraged to seek novel healthcare
        technologies to help elder people. </p>
      <p>I’m a research assistant in <a href="https://www.eldertech.missouri.edu">Center for Eldercare & Rehabilitation
          Technology</a>, and I have designed several eldercare applications. My projects are listed below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Echo System</li>
        <p>Technology is constantly pioneering new paths in health care by creating new outlets for medical professionals to care for their patients. With the development of wearable sensors and enhanced forms of wireless communication like Bluetooth low energy (BLE) communication, health data can now be collected wirelessly without compromising the independence of patients. Interactive voice interfaces such as the Amazon Echo provide an easy way for individuals to access a variety of data by using voice commands, making interacting with technology easier for those of limited technological experience. Wearable sensors, such as the Angel Sensor, combined with voice interactive devices, such as the Amazon Echo, have allowed for the development of applications that provide easy user interaction. Here, we propose a smart application that monitors health status by combining the data collection capabilities of the Angel sensor and the voice interfacing capabilities of the Amazon Echo. We also present test results of the Amazon Echo speech recognition on different populations. </p>
        <li>Rehabilitation Game for People with Stroke</li>
        <p>We explore a quantitative assessment for a Microsoft Kinect-based stroke rehabilitation virtual reality (VR) video game, Mystic Isle, by evaluating three assessment metrics of player hand movement-- maximum range (extension), peak velocity and mean velocity. We also analyze the left-right hand symmetry by visualizing trajectories of both hands throughout the game.  Assessment metrics obtained by the Kinect-based game have been validated using a Vicon motion capture system. The percentage errors of maximum range and mean velocity are less than 10%. The peak velocity metric is more sensitive to noise and sampling rate with a percentage error up to 18%.</p>
        <li>Daily Activity Recognition and Assessment System</li>
        <p>Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. Stroke patients can recover faster with personalized therapy treatments. This requires both clinical assessments and in-home assessments of daily activities. In this paper, we propose a daily activity recognition and assessment system for stroke patients. Our system is able to classify daily activities in real home environments and quantitatively evaluate upper body motions while preserving privacy by utilizing depth videos. Specifically, our system collects the depth videos and skeletal joint data of daily activities using a VicoVR sensor. It then recognizes and localizes clinically relevant actions from continuous untrimmed depth videos using a customized convolutional de-convolutional network. In addition, it assesses the extent of reach and speed metrics of both hands using skeletal joint data. The system has been tested on simulated cooking videos and real-life cooking videos in various kitchens with different room layouts and light conditions. The action recognition accuracies for simulated and real-life videos can reach 90.9% and 87.5%, respectively. With the valuable assessment feedback of our system, therapists can make better personalized treatments for stroke patients.</p>
